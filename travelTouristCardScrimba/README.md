## Travel Tourist Card - Scrimba Project 

> I completed this project as part of the my #100DaysofCode Challenge. I completed it over day 3 and day 4. 

During this project, my learning and focus goals were:

- [x] Increasing confidence with Flexbox
- [x] Not repeating CSS code - which code could be inherited
- [x] Use of background: linear-gradient()
- [x] Use of background-image: url()

The three main challenges I faced were:

- [] The flex-box items having different sizes. I solved this by using flex-basis.
- [] The background: linear-gradient() did not fit the entire page. I solved this by using background-attachment: fixed;
- [] Positioning the tour guide card. I solved this by adding in an additional <div class="empty-container">
